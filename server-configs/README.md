# Example Server Configurations
This repository contains example Directus configuration files for alternate/unofficial server stacks. Please keep in mind that **these configurations are not officially supported** â€” they are only for reference and may not work properly. Visit [our requirements page](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/requirements.html) for more information on officially supported servers.

We welcome the community to offer configs for new servers, or recommend adjustments to existing ones!
